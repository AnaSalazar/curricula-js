## XMLHTTPRequest

Just like how the document is provided by the JavaScript engine, the JavaScript engine also provides a way for us to make asynchronous HTTP requests. We do that with an XMLHttpRequest object. We can create these objects with the provided XMLHttpRequest constructor function.

One of the best ways to learn is to get your hands dirty and try things out! So go to Unsplash, open up the developer tools, and run the following on the console:

const asyncRequestObject = new XMLHttpRequest();
Confusingly, the constructor function has "XML" in it, but it's not limited to only XML documents. Remember that the "AJAX" acronym used to stand for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML". Since the main file format that was originally used for asynchronous data exchange were XML files, it's easy to see why the function is called XMLHttpRequest!

XMLHttpRequests (commonly abbreviated as XHR or xhr) can be used to request any file type (e.g. plain text files, HTML files, JSON files, image files, etc.) or data from an API.

Note: We'll be digging into the XMLHttpRequest object. We'll look at how to create it, what methods and properties need to be used, and how to actually send asynchronous requests. For even more info on using the XHR object to make async requests, check out these links:

MDN's docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/open
WHATWG Spec - https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/
W3C Spec - https://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/

## XHR's object `.open()` method

So we've constructed an XHR object named asyncRequestObject. There are a number of methods that are available to us. One of the most important is the open method.

asyncRequestObject.open();
.open() takes a number of parameters, but the most important are its first two: the HTTP method URL to send the request

If we want to asynchronously request the homepage from the popular high-res image site, Unsplash, we'd use a GET request and provide the URL:

asyncRequestObject.open('GET', 'https://unsplash.com');
A little rusty on your HTTP methods?
The main two that you'll be using are:

GET - to retrieve data
POST - to send data
For more info, check out our course on HTTP & Web Servers!

Warning: For security reasons, you can only make requests for assets and data on the same domain as the site that will end up loading the data. For example, to asynchronously request data from google.com your browser needs to be on google.com. This is known as the same-origin policy. This might seem extremely limiting, and it is!

The reason for this is because JavaScript has control over so much information on the page. It has access to all cookies and can determine passwords since it can track what keys are pressed. However, the web wouldn't be what it is today if all information was bordered off in its own silos. The way to circumvent the same-origin policy is with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). CORS must a technology that is implemented on the server. Services that provide APIs use CORS to allow developers to circumvent the same-origin policy and access their information.

## XHR's object `.send()` method

To actually send the request, we need to use the send method:

```javascript
asyncRequestObject.send();
```

Let's check out what happens:

It's a little pointless to make a request for something but then do absolutely nothing with it! Why would you order some cake and then not go to pick it up or not eat it? The horror! We want to eat our cake, too!

## Handling Success

To handle the successful response of an XHR request, we set the onload property on the object to a function that will handle it:

```javascript
function handleSuccess () {
    // in the function, the `this` value is the XHR object
    // this.responseText holds the response from the server

    console.log( this.responseText ); // the HTML of https://unsplash.com/
}

asyncRequestObject.onload = handleSuccess;
```

As we just saw, if onload isn't set, then the request does return...but nothing happens with it.

## Handling Errors

You might've picked up that onload is called when the response is successful. If something happens with the request and it can't be fulfilled, then we need to use the onerror property:

```javascript
function handleError () {
    // in the function, the `this` value is the XHR object
    console.log( 'An error occurred ðŸ˜ž' );
}

asyncRequestObject.onerror = handleError;
```

As with onload, if onerror isn't set and an error occurs, that error will just fail silently and your code (and your user!) won't have any idea what's wrong or any way to recover.

## Putting it together

Here's the full code that we've built up that creates the XHR object, tells it what info to request, sets up handlers for a success or error, and then actually sends the request:

```javascript
function handleSuccess () { 
  console.log( this.responseText ); 
  // the HTML of https://unsplash.com/
}

function handleError () { 
  console.log( 'An error occurred \uD83D\uDE1E' );
}

const asyncRequestObject = new XMLHttpRequest();
asyncRequestObject.open('GET', 'https://unsplash.com');
asyncRequestObject.onload = handleSuccess;
asyncRequestObject.onerror = handleError;
asyncRequestObject.send();
```

## APIs and JSON

Getting the HTML of a website is ok, but it's probably not very useful. The data it returns is in a format that is extremely difficult to parse and consume. It would be a lot easier if we could get just the data we want in an easily formatted data structure. If you're thinking that JSON would be a good idea, then you're right and I'll give you a piece of my cake!

Instead of requesting the base URL for Unsplash, let's create an app that pulls an image from Unsplash's API and relevant articles from the New York Times.

When making a request from an API that returns JSON, all we need to do is convert that JSON response into a JavaScript object. We can do that with JSON.parse();. Let's tweak the onload function to handle a JSON response:

```javascript
function handleSuccess () {
  const data = JSON.parse( this.responseText ); // convert data from JSON to a JavaScript object
  console.log( data );
}

asyncRequestObject.onload = handleSuccess;
```
